# AgentKit

AgentKit is a toolkit that gives AI agents access to crypto wallets and onchain functionality. Powered by the 0xGasless AgentKit SDK, it allows agents to autonomously perform any onchain interaction, including transfers, swaps, token deployments, and arbitrary contract invocations. Our **agent quickstart** can get an agent running using AgentKit in less than 5 minutes.

## Overview

AgentKit provides:

- Model-agnostic design that works with several LLM APIs, including OpenAI, Claude, and Llama.
- Plugs into any AI agent framework.
- Native integration with the 0xGasless AgentKit SDK for onchain capabilities, including:
  - Smart contract deployments
  - Trades
  - Transfers
  - Contract reads and writes
  - Price feeds
- Template structure for adding custom functionality.
- Support for **[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)** and any existing LangChain tools.

# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->
